# WeCare-bootstrap-website

It is a concept for a Responsive Health Organization website built by using Bootstrap that offers a variety of health services to its clientele. This website contains various sections through which user can easily navigate themselves. The purpose for building this project was to study and practise about the user interface of a website. I also learned how Bootstrap works and used it in this project.
